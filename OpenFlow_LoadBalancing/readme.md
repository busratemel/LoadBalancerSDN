We designed a dynamic load balancer (DLB) to make some flow improvements on fat-tree networks by using SDN technology. 
DLB utilizes link usage and makes decisions based on real-time traffic statistics obtained via the OpenFlow protocol. 
We have implemented DLB as bash-script program with two main functions: monitoring traffic and pushing flows. 
We used the Mininet Network Emulator and Floodlight Controller.
